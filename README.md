The Pharmacy Management System is a C++ program developed to facilitate efficient handling of pharmacy operations, specifically focusing on order management, customer interactions, and medicine inventory. The system is structured around a `pharmacy` struct, which holds detailed information about each order, including order numbers, customer names, dates, medicine details (IDs, quantities, names), and the total cost of the order.

Key functionalities of the system include:

1. **Order Management**:
   - **Take New Orders**: Allows users to input new medicine orders, specifying the type and quantity of each medicine. The system calculates and displays
   - the total cost for the order.
   - **Modify Orders**: Users can update existing orders by changing medicine details or customer information.
   - **Delete Orders**: Users can delete orders from the system.

2. **Receipt and Payment**:
   - **Print Receipts**: Generates a receipt for a given order, detailing the medicines purchased, quantities, and total amount due. Users can also record payments and calculate any remaining balance or change to be returned.

3. **Daily Summary**:
   - **Sales Summary**: Provides a summary of the total sales for the day, listing each medicine sold, its quantity, and the total price.

4. **Data Persistence**:
   - **Save Data**: Saves all order details to a file, ensuring that data is not lost when the program is closed.
   - **Load Data**: Loads order details from a file, allowing the system to retain information between sessions.

5. **User Interface**:
   - A simple text-based menu interface allows users to navigate through the different functionalities easily.

The program ensures that all operations are handled efficiently, making it easier for pharmacy staff to manage orders and inventory while maintaining accurate records of sales and transactions.
